#Local M2 Repository

Last four years have been experimenting with different java api's and frameworks, always my local m2 help me to pull up dependencies most of the time, up & running with out connecting to external world, pretty much heavy weight repository, time to clean up and upgrade, the safe way to restore in new PC is through this repository. 

It's that clean up job, doing it.
